* pypkg -- a bare-bones python package

#+options: author:nil num:nil toc:nil

This is an outline of the kind of python package I usually make.  Use it as
a starting point, replacing =pypkg= throughout, or just steal the bits you
like.  Summary of features:

- A =README= in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org]] format, with auto-conversion to reStructuredText and
  Markdown.

- Prepopulated =setup.cfg= with the most common entries.

- Requirement pinning in the =conf= directory.

- A =Makefile= for handling common targets (development, testing, upload to
  PyPI), with cute self-documenting help gimmick.

For best results, you'll need to install several python packages
(pip-tools, build, twine, flake8, mypy).

A doctest to see if python is working:
